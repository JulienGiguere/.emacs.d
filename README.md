# jimeh's .emacs.d (a.k.a. Emacs-Siren)

This is my personal Emacs config, currently nicknamed Emacs-Siren, and heavily
inspired by [Emacs Prelude](https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude).

However, this is not some form of an Emacs starter kit, it's simply my personal
config with any quirks, oddities, bugs, and man-eating errors I live with on a
daily basis.

## Requirements

- Emacs 24.5 or later. Earlier versions might work, but I haven't tested them.

## Installation

1. Clone the repo to `~/.emacs.d`, and update git submodules:

        git clone git://github.com/jimeh/.emacs.d.git ~/.emacs.d
        cd ~/.emacs.d
        git submodule init
        git submodule update

2. Launch Emacs and wait a few minutes while it installs all missing packages.
3. Enjoy ^_^
